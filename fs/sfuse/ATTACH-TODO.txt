				ATTACH TODO

* CHECK FOR ANY CONCEIVABLE ERROR

fist_ioctl +a /mnt/sfuse abc /n/fist/sfuse/zadok
	oops if /n/fist/sfuse/zadok doesn't exist
	CPW: Fixed, hidden_dentry not correctly validated.

ensure that only file owners are allowed to attach to their own directories
	what about the privs of mount point?
	CPW: Should it be owners or people with READ/EXEC perms?
	Check that MAY_EXEC and MAY_READ are permitted on to.


ensure that you can only attach to directories.
	CPW: S_ISDIR added.

* works

- stat /mnt/sfuse/nonexistent IS OK

- stat /mnt/sfuse/abd/nonexistent IS OK

* bugs

stat /mnt/sfuse/abd/date.txt (exists)
	oops1 in sfuse_interpose.
	fixed: had to do w/ using static inode numbers.

Problem: attach node and hidden one may have different names!
	is that a problem in our expected code?
check if
	fist_ioctl +a /mnt/sfuse zadok /n/fist/sfuse/zadok
	makes a different wrt oops1
	Nope: we still get an oops

- busy inodes after umount (kernel message)
	probably b/c we haven't implemented detach yet

- at some point I got an oops from "ls /mnt/sfuse/abc"
	can't reproduce it.
	I think it was in file ops (release)

- CPW: The attached name changed from "compile2" to "compile2ZZZZ"
  Then it disappeared while I was doing 2 concurrent gcc compiles.
